            Most Kenyan dishes are filling and inexpensive to make. Staple foods consist mainly of corn, maize, potatoes, and beans. 
            Ugali (a porridge made of maize) and meat are typically eaten inland, while the coastal peoples eat a more varied diet.
            Kenyan food is generally described as eclectically mixed with no particular dish representing the country. Instead, each community has its own 
            native food with staples consisting of corn and other grains such as sorghum and millet, depending on the region, and paired with various meats and vegetables.

        <p>
            Nyama choma is a Swahili word that directly translates to burnt meat (i.e., grilled meat or roast meat). It is primarily made from goat meat, although other meats can be used. 
            It's a dish synonymous with celebrations and special occasions, like weddings, graduations, birthdays, or weekends out with friends and family
            The meat is usually goat or beef, served roasted throughout the country, from roadside shacks to fine restaurants. It is often paired with local beer and side dishes such as ugali.

            Mandazi (Swahili: Mandazi, Maandazi) is a form of fried bread that originated on the Swahili Coast.
            It is also known as bofrot or puff puff in Western African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. It is one of the principal dishes in the cuisine 
            of the Swahili people who inhabit the Coastal Region of Kenya and Tanzania. The dish is popular in the region, as it is convenient to make,
            can be eaten with almost any food or dips or just as a snack by itself, and can be saved and reheated for later consumption
