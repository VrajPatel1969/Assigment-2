            Kenya is one of Africa's most renowned and accessible safari destinations. The country offers an exceptional variety and density of wildlife,
            including the “Big Five” which consists of the lion, elephant, rhinoceros, African buffalo, and leopard. The “Big Five” was a term coined by 
            hunters to encompass the most difficult and dangerous animals to hunt, as well as the most desired trophies. 
            Fortunately, today, the only shots being taken are with cameras, but sightings of these animals remain as coveted as ever.

            Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, 
            contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. 
            It is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin.
            The Masai Mara features a stunning kaleidoscope of wild and rugged landscapes, warm and welcoming people and an exciting array of creatures
            big and small. World famous for hosting the epic Great Migration, the Masai Mara welcomes 1,5 million wildebeests onto its sprawling savannahs each July through October.

            At 5,199 m, Mount Kenya is the second highest peak in Africa and is an ancient extinct volcano. 
            There are 12 remnant glaciers on the mountain, all receding rapidly, and four secondary peaks that sit at the head of the U-shaped glacial valleys.
            Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano which originally rose an estimated 3 million years ago and last erupted an estimated 2.6 million years ago. 
            Mount Kenya National Park was formed in 1949 and in 1978 the site became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve before finally being named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.
